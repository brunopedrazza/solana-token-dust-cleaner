# Solana Token Dust Cleaner

A command-line utility to clean up "dust" tokens from your Solana wallet. This tool helps you burn unwanted tokens and close token accounts to reclaim rent (SOL) and declutter your wallet.

## What is Token Dust?

Token dust refers to small amounts of tokens that accumulate in your Solana wallet over time from various interactions, airdrops, failed transactions, or trading activities. Each token account requires rent (approximately 0.00203928 SOL), and these small balances can add up while cluttering your wallet.

## Features

- üßπ **Clean Wallet**: Automatically detect and close unused token accounts
- üí∞ **Reclaim Rent**: Get back the SOL locked in token account rent
- üîí **Safe Operation**: Interactive confirmation for each token before processing
- üí≤ **Price Awareness**: Shows USD value of tokens using DexScreener API
- üî• **Smart Burning**: Burns token balances before closing accounts when necessary
- üìÅ **Flexible Key Input**: Support for both raw private key and file-based keypairs
- ‚ö° **Efficient Transactions**: Batches multiple operations into a single transaction

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A Solana wallet with some SOL for transaction fees

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brunopedrazza/solana-token-dust-cleaner.git
cd solana-token-dust-cleaner
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Run the dust cleaner:

```bash
npm start
```

The tool will guide you through the process:

1. **Choose Private Key Method**: 
   - Paste your private key directly (hidden input)
   - Load from a keypair file (JSON format)

2. **Review Token Accounts**: 
   - The tool scans your wallet for token accounts
   - For each token, it shows:
     - Token mint address
     - Token symbol (if available)
     - Balance amount
     - USD value (if available)

3. **Confirm Actions**: 
   - You'll be asked to confirm each token account closure
   - Extra confirmation for tokens worth more than $1 USD

4. **Batch Transaction**: 
   - All confirmed operations are batched into a single transaction
   - Final confirmation before sending to the network

## What Happens During Cleaning

For each token account you choose to clean:

1. **Burn Tokens** (if balance > 0): Destroys any remaining token balance
2. **Close Account**: Closes the token account and returns rent to your wallet
3. **Reclaim Rent**: ~0.00203928 SOL per account returned to your wallet

## Security Features

- üîê **Local Execution**: Your private key never leaves your machine
- ‚úÖ **Interactive Confirmation**: Manual approval required for each action
- üí° **Value Protection**: Extra confirmation for tokens with significant value
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Safe error handling for network issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Insufficient SOL for transaction fees"**
- Ensure your wallet has enough SOL to cover transaction fees (~0.0001-0.001 SOL)

**"Account not found"**
- Token account might already be closed or the mint address is invalid

**"Transaction failed"**
- Network congestion or RPC issues; try again later

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify your private key format
3. Ensure sufficient SOL balance for fees
4. Try again during lower network congestion
